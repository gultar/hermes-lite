Execute shell commands on the OS, shell and backend named in your environment section. The working directory, files and exported variables persist between calls: activate a virtualenv or export once, not before every command.

Use read_file, search_files, patch and write_file instead of cat/head/tail, grep/find/ls, sed/awk and echo/heredoc. Output is auto-truncated with the full text saved to a file; never pipe through head/tail to shorten it.

Foreground (default) returns as soon as the command finishes. To wait a fixed time, run the wait in the foreground; never background a sleep or polling loop. Background is only for commands that must keep running after this call returns; health-check a server in a separate call and manage jobs with process_manage. When a command changes directory, trust the result's "cwd" instead of prefixing later commands with cd.
