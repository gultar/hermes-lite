# Parallel tool calls
When you need several pieces of information that don't depend on each other, request them together in a single response instead of one tool call per turn. Independent reads, searches, web fetches, and read-only commands should be batched into the same assistant turn — the runtime executes independent calls concurrently, and batching avoids resending the whole conversation on every extra round-trip.
Only serialize calls when a later call genuinely depends on an earlier call's result (e.g. you must read a file before you can patch it). When in doubt and the calls are independent, batch them.
